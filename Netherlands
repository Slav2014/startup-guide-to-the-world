<p>
    First established as the Kingdom in 1815, The Netherlands has always been religiously and socially divided country. Today the low chamber of the Dutch bicameral Parliament - 150-members <i>Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal</i> - contains more than a dozed political parties and groups, with largest among them - the pro-government, conservative "Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie" (VVD) - holding on to 33 seats and the rival - right-wing "<i>Partij voor de Vrijheid</i>" (PVV) - represented by 20 deputies. After October 2017 elections <i>der Staten-Generaal</i> is split almost evenly (76 to 74) between parties, which supports current central government's pro-EU policies, and the opposition, which expresses more radical, nationalists views.

    Traditionally high reliance of Dutch economy on the EU export has condemned it to the slow post-crisis recovery. The Dutch GDP growth rate has been oscillating between 0% and 3% for almost a decade. At the same time, The Netherlands possesses well developed telecommunication infrastructure and highly educated workforce. Together with the large service sector it provides multiple business opportunities to tech startup founders. On the other hand, continuing economic slowdown, high unemployment rate, which encourages brain-drain, and high tax rates have already slowed down the growth of the local startups ecosystem.

	While trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs is legal in The Netherlands, most exchanges apply strict Antiâ€“Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) standards. Meanwhile, according to the Dutch central bank (DNB), digital currencies fall outside the scope of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, meaning the DNB does not have a supervisory authority over these currencies. However, the investigative arm of the Dutch tax authority (the FIOD) aims to prosecute unlicensed crypto traders.
</p>
<p>
	As part of that effort, the FIOD wants to have mixing services recognized as money-laundering indicators. Users of mixing services would be assumed guilty, unless they could prove otherwise. In sum, it indicates that, although, Dutch authorities follow the situation with digital currencies very closely there has been a clear discrepancy in their responses to this challenge. Under those conditions the future of crypto in The Netherlands remains uncertain.
