<p>
	Left-wing <b>Social Democratic Party</b> has been dominating Swedish political scene, leading both the Parliament and the government, since 1917. In 2000th, however, voters' sentiments started to shift, fragmenting the power landscape. Today 349-members "Riksdag" consists of two political groups: pro-government "Social Democratic Party" (113 seats) allied with the "Green party" (25) and the opposition, composed from "Moderate Party" (83), "Center Party" (22), "Liberal People's Party" (19), "Christian Democrats" (169), "Sweden Democrats" (45) and 5 independent deputies.

	Export-orientated Swedish industries are not in a good shape because of the European protracted post-crisis economic stagnation. Sweden's GDP growth rate has not yet recovered to its 2007 levels. The unemployment rate has been decreasing only too slowly, moving from 10% in 2010 to about 7% in 2017. Those factors have negatively affected the growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem. Additionally, the heavy tax burden, needed to maintain Sweden's generous welfare system, has encouraged many tech founders to move their companies outside of country's borders.

	Sweden together with Norway and Denmark are striving to become cashless countries. Bitcoin and its peers are right up to Sweden authorities' alley. Not surprisingly then that "Sveriges Riksbank" (Sweden's central bank) is considering issuing a digital currency of its own. However, there are no laws in Sweden regulating digital currencies use. So far it has been substituted by government's departmental bylaws. For example, the Swedish Tax Agency has given a preliminary ruling on Value Added Tax (VAT) on Bitcoins, stating that trade in Bitcoins is not subject to Value Added Tax. At the same time, Finansinspektionen (Financial Supervisory Authority) is more likely to be treating Bitcoins as a currency. Meanwhile, trading crypto and organizing ICOs stay legal in Sweden.
