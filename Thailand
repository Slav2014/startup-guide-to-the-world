<p>
 	<b>24 June 1932</b> Thailand switched its political system from an absolute to <b>constitutional monarchy</b>. Thailand had, then, lived through <b>19 coup d'etat</b> and changed <b>20 Constitutions</b>. Today Thailand is ruled by the <b>National Council for Peace and Order</b>, headed by the military. Members of the National Legislative Assembly (220-seats Parliament) is appointed by this Council.

<p>
 	Thailand has the second largest economy in Southeast Asia with its GDP exceeding <b>$400 billion</b>. Thailand is also the <b>second biggest</b> World producer of <b>HDD disks</b>, one of the major rice exporters on the planet and the main beneficiary of the <b>international travelers' boom</b> of 1990th - 2000th. However, Thai rural population is poor and mostly employed in the <b>informal sectors</b>.

	Thailand thriving computer manufacturing and tourism industries have provided a number of market opportunities to startup founders. On the other side, Thailand economy is gradually cooling down. Furthermore, 76 Thailand provinces have drastically different level of the industrial development with most of the manufacturing facilities spread across 15 provinces while the rest are relying on proceeds from tourism sector. Those factors as well as the growing competition from neighboring states for funds and tech talents have decreased the growth potential of the local startup ecosystem.

<p>
	Cryptocurrencies' legal status in Thailand is dubious. In January 2014 the Bank of Thailand declared that Bitcoin is not recognized as a legal tender. It, basically, means that Thai based Bitcoin exchanges can only trade crypto for Thai Baht and are required to operate with an e-commerce license issued by Thailand Business Development Department. At the same time, the Bank of Thailand had also stated that buying and selling of Bitcoin is illegal.
</p>
<p>
	Fitting those two pieces of information together isn't easy. However, it's obvious that Thai authorities has not found it practical to persecute multiple Bitcoin exchanges still existing in Thailand. It may be treated as an unspoken message from authorities to businesses, which (message), basically, says that "whatever you do with Bitcoin you do it at your own risk".
