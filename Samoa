<p>
    Political system of Samoa is a mixture of <b>Fa'amatai</b> and the <b>Westminster</b> statue. <i>Matai</i> (family chiefs) had run this country long before Britain, United States, Germany and New Zealand set their soldiers' feet on it.  Still, 49-members "<b>Fono Aoao Faitulafono</b>" (the National Legislative Assembly) includes only representatives of 25,000 matai. Samoa Prime Minister, which is elected by Fono members, is one of four Samoa royal chiefs (<b>Tama-a-Aiga</b>). 
<p>
	Samoa's small population, limited volume and subsidized, predominately agricultural character of the local economy, deficit of qualified personnel, absence of seed financing, legal and administrative barriers, high costs, explained by the geographical isolation of the country - all of those negative factors have imposed a severe limits on the size and growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem. On a positive side, local startup founders can find some limited market opportunities in e-service (tourism) sector of mobile Internet.

	 In June 2017 the Central Bank of Samoa issued <a href="https://www.cbs.gov.ws/index.php/media/latest-news/beware-of-getting-rick-at-these-new-article-page/">a statement</a> warning against digital currency. It reads: "We wish to advise the general public to be very cautious and diligent in dealing with get rich quick schemes or digital currency investments. ... If you come across these difficult and complex financial concepts and investments, please contact the Central Bank of Samoa for more information." However, it looks like CBS itself has a very limited knowledge about cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, trading digital money as well as organizing ICOs are still legal in Samoa.
