<h2 align = 'center'> Luxembourg (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) </h2>

<p>
	Luxembourg is located on the border between Germany and France. Both of those two countries, which have been political and economic rivals for centuries, heavily influenced Duchy's historical destiny as well as its culture and its people. Old bastions of Luxembourg fortress, which was recognized by UNESCO as one of the World's heritage sites, remind us of that era in European history, when descendants of Gauls and Teutons knights had uselessly spent their resources, time and blood in innumerable conflicts, induced by their fullish and greedy rulers.
</p>

<p>
	After so many centuries of being between the rock and the hard place Duchy has managed to convert its painful historical experience into prudent and practical politics. Among other preventive measures, undertaken by its rulers against follies of giant neighboring states, Luxembourg had became one of the founding members of NATO on 4 April 1949.
</p>

<p>
	Luxembourg is widely recognized as one of the major financial centers of the European Union. Most of the active and well-established VC firms run there a representative office. That is one of the important factors, which provides local startups an additional competitive advantage over its counterparts in neighboring countries. Fintech industry serves as one of the main cornerstones of local startup ecosystem. At the same time, Luxembourgish small economy, tiny population, hight level of competition and high costs of running business re-orientate local startup founders on EU markets.
</p>
<p>
	Duchy's financial regulators, including Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) and the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), haven't yet come up with specific legal framework regulating virtual currencies. At the same time, the general stance of local bureaucrats on the issue of crypto appears to be positive. It had first been confirmed in April 2016 when one of the largest crypto-exchanges announced that Luxembourg has granted it a payment institution license. Trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs is legal in Luxembourg and this status is unlikely to be changed in the nearest future.
