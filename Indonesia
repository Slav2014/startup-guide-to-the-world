<h2 align = 'center'> Indonesia (Republic of Indonesia) </h2>


<p>
	Indonesia declared its independence on August 1945, after more than a century of Dutch colonial rule and a short-lived mis-alliance with the Imperial Japan, which had been spearheaded by the <b>Partai Nasional Indonesia</b> (PNI) under the guidance of the former architect <b>Kusno Sosrodihardjo (Sukarno)</b>.
</p>
<p>
	Sukarno stayed in power until 1966 when he was replaced by the major general <b>Suharto</b>. Suharto replaced Sukarno's "guided democracy" by the new-kensian economic program, supported by the armed force. It led to an unprecedented GDP growth (from $800 billion in 1970th to $4 trillion in 1990th) and the wide-spread corruption. 1998 Asian financial crisis brought Suharto's presidency and the military dictatorship to the end.
</p>
<p>
	 Acting Indonesian president - former furnuture manufacturer and the mayor of Surakarta <b>Joko Widodo</b> - was elected by popular vote on October 2014. 
</p>
<p>
	The pro-government faction ("The Great Indonesia Coalition", which includes 7 parties) in the lower chamber of Indonesian Parliament - 560-members <b>Dewan Perwakilan Daerah</b> - is led by the <b>Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan</b> (109 seats), which is inspired by the Pancasila ideology. The opposition is represented by "The Red and White Coalition", where major role is played by the "Partai Gerakan Indonesia Raya, Gerindra" (73 seats), which is headed by the former Indonesian special forces commander and is backed by the army.
</p>
<p>
	Indonesia possesses an extensive natural resources including crude oil, gas, copper and gold. It's the world's leading producers of <i>palm oil</i> providing about 50% of world's supply. Oil palm plantations occupy 6 million hectares and threaten to eradicate the tropical forests cover. Indonesia is also 17th largest world's producer of cars.
</p>
<p>
	Indonesian economy provides local tech founders with multiple market opportunities. However, low mid-income consumers, high administrative and legal barriers to SME, regional inequality (specifically in the level of telecommunication infrastructure development), difficulty in gaining seed and VC financing have negatively affected growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
	In February 2014, <a href="http://www.bi.go.id/en/Default.aspx">"The Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia"</a> announced that digital currencies are neither currency nor legal payment tools in Indonesia. It also advised people to stay away from Bitcoin and other virtual money. However, since then no actions have been taken against local crypto-exchanges and trading coins as well as organizing ICOs are still technically legal in this country. However, that intermediary period is not likely to exist for very long and the harsh regulatory regime will likely to be implemented in the mid-term perspectives.
