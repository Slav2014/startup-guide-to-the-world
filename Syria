<h2 align = 'center'> Syria (Syrian Arab Republic) </h2>

<p>
	In seven years, which have passed since the start of the Syrian civil war, this country has been converted into one of the major destabilizing factors of the contemporary international politics. This war's origin is almost forgotten today and what, initially, was a local skirmish between the Ba'ath Party regime and disenfranchised Syrian youth has now became the global stand-off, which involves all of world's major power-houses.
</p>
<p>
	Even after ISIS has stopped to play the main villain's role in this troubled region, other factors, such as the Kurdish separatism and old animosity, existing between Shiite Iranian and Sunny Saudi Arabian autocrats, continue to rise temperature in the Syrian oven. Now, when military-industrial complexes of U.S.A. and Russia confront each other in the Hamad wilderness, the stakes in this blood-chilling geopolitical game  have became even higher.
</p>
<p>
	All types of economic activities, including startup entrepreneurship, conducted in the conflict zones, are the subject of so many eventualities that it render them almost heroic. Additionally, with so many Syrian men still fighting for various causes on remaining local battlefields, woman have become families' main bred-earners.
</p>
<p>
	In the prewar period Syria had developed over-regulated, highly centralized economy of the pseudo socialist type, which was largely dependent on the oil export. During the war, some of the large cities, including Damascus, located outside of battles regions and ISIS occupation zones, have mostly preserved their local industries, such as transportation, restaurant, entertainment and hospitality, almost intact. Those areas are still capable to provide local startups founders with some business opportunities.
</p>
<p>
	At the same time, continuing political and social disorder, extensive governmental presence in economy, impoverished population, outdated and, in some regions, partially obliterated, infrastructure, inadequacy of local educational system to contemporary technological standard and absence of VC capital have severely limited the growth potentials of the local startup ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
	The Central Bank of Syria and other country's financial regulatory authorities haven't yet clarified their official position on crypto-currencies. Meanwhile, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain legal in Syria. In a foreseeable future, even if some restrictions or a complete ban on using digital money are introduced in this country, it will be very difficult, if possible at all, to enforce its on all of country's territory.

<p>
	Business Notes for Startups Founders:
	<ul>		
		<li>political climate: hostile;</li>
		<li>economic climate: very unfriendly;</li>
		<li>regions to focus: locally, Middle East;</li>
		<li>industries to focus: e-commerce, education, advertisement;</li>
		<li>major limitations: prewar economy was based on oil extraction, which constituted about 60% of Syrian export revenues, GDP annual growth rate at (minus) -6 percent, inflation at almost 50 percent, inadequate legal regulation, unsound or destroyed infrastructure, near absence of seed and VC capitals, limited workforce, poor population (per capita at $1700);</li>
		<li>stimulus: young population, new market niches, low competitions.</li>
		<li>opportunities: may be found in big cities;</li>
		<li>Cryptocurrencies and ICOs (outlook): legal (positive).</li>
