<h2 align = 'center'> Antigua and Barbuda </h2>

<p>
	Antigua and Barbuda is part of the Commonwealth, which makes Queen Elizabeth its head-of-state. The leading political party in Antigua is the conservative "Antigua and Barbuda Labor Party" (ABLP), which holds on to 14 seats in the 17-members lower chamber of the bicameral parliament. The opposition is represented by three deputies, which together forms the left-wing " United Progressive Party" parliamentary faction.
</p>
<p>
	Local politics has a pronounced elitist character. For more than 40 years it has been dominated by the Birds family. Several successive generations of this political dynasty have occupied leading posts in ABLP, until Lester Bryan Bird was replaced by the former banker Gaston Browne on the 2012 prime minister's elections. 
</p>
<p>
	Antigua and Barbuda's main economic advantages are its comprehensive legal systems, which is based on the English common law, temperate climate and sandy beaches with picturesque small lagoons. Tourist industry accounts for more than 50% of Antigua and Barbuda's one-billion-dollars GDP. Antigua and Barbuda's banking sector is the second largest in the Eastern Caribbean Region.
</p>
<p>
	Today Antigua is a prosperous Caribbean state, which serves as one of the world's main financial off-shore centers and the prime holiday travels'  destination for US tourists. However, the local startup ecosystem is significantly underdeveloped due to the lack of economic incentives to innovations, a tiny consumers' base and shortage of qualified personnel. On a positive side, the developed banking sector may serve as a catalyst for FinTech startups.
</p>
<p>
	In April 2017 there were rumors on the market that the government of Antigua is drafting laws to accept cryptocurrencies for government services. However, since then it hasn't been any legal motions reported in Antigua. Whether or not it means that this project is in the slow-motion mode, on a hold or is already abandoned are remained to be seen. Meanwhile, trading crypo as well as organizing ICOs stay legal in Antigua and Barbuda.

	Antigua and Barbuda is the country with successful but controversial approach to a difficult task of building the thriving startup ecosystem on a couple of small Caribbean islands. As the result, Antigua is today well known for having prolonged legal disputes with USA on questions of on-line gambling and copy-rights issues.

From the mid-1990th the government of Antigua wholeheartedly welcomed on-line casinos to its territory. However, at some point it led to the direct legal confrontation with USA the outcome of which wasn't positive at all for Antigua.

Today those types of startups are no longer the preferred options for local tech entrepreneurs. What they are now left with are a tiny although wealthy population and a short list of industries to work with, among which most prominent are tourism and banking.

There is, however, still the hope left that e-business friendly authorities of Antigua will find new ways to revitalize the powerful startups engine of those highly promising but already left-behind sea-lands.
