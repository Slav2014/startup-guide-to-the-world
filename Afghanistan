<h2 align = 'center'> Afghanistan (Islamic Republic of Afghanistan) </h2>


<p>
    Afghanistan has always been in the focus of international politics, which resulted in multiple foreign interventions and civil conflicts. Latest 50 years have been especially eventful:
    <li>1978 - Saur Revolution;</li>
    <li>1979 - Soviet Union army invasion;</li>
    <li>1989 - Soviets withdraw;</li>
    <li>1992 - the Islamic State of Afghanistan proclaimed and mujahideens (guerrilla militants) came to power;</li>
    <li>1996 - the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan proclaimed, Taliban (students anti-Western movement) rose to power;</li>
    <li>2001 - US lead Operation "Enduring Freedom" ordered;</li>
    <li>2003 - the new democratic constitution is approved by majority of population, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan proclaimed.
</p>
<p>
   Today, political power in Afghanistan is divided between central authorities, represented by Kabul government, and regional, tribal groups. The current Afghan President - <b>Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai</b>, a former World Bank's official, and a representative of Ahmadzai Pashtuns - is the head of state and of army. He selects cabinets members with the consent of the bicameral National Assembly.
</p>
<p>
   The later includes 249-seats House of the People (<b>Meshrano Jirga</b>) and 102-seats House of Elders (<b>Wolesi Jirga</b>). Parliamentarians are appointed by President and by provincial councils in equal proportion. There are 34 Afghan provinces ('wilayats') and each of them has its own Capital and Government. Currently, provincial disagreements negatively affect Afghan politics.
</p>
<p>
   There are more than 50 independent political parties in Afghanistan. However, four major ethnic groups traditionally dominate Afghanistan politics: Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek. Additionally, sharp economic division, existing between Pashtun South and the North (where the rest of Afghan population lives), further intensifies Afghan internal power struggle.
</p>
<p>
    There are three parties in Meshrano Jirga with more than 10 seats - the <b>Jamayat-E-Islami</b> (represents Afghan Tajiks), PIUPA or <b>People's Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan</b> (Hazara) and Junbish or <b>National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan</b> (Uzbek). However, none of those groups holds the decisive majority. 
</p>
<p>
	According to some reports, Afghanistan mineral wealth (including large deposits of oil and other resources) is estimated at $3 trillion. However, the majority of the Afghan population is still living under the poverty line and more than 30% of people are unemployed. Local economy is largely based on subsistent agriculture and country's infrastructure is largely underdeveloped.
</p>
<p>
	On top of that, political uncertainties undermine local investment climate and make seed and VC investments almost unattainable for local startup founders. At the same time, new generation of mobile Internet users (notably in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar) create the large consumers base for e-businesses in e-commerce, FinTech, entertainments, social networks and media.
