<h2 align = 'center'> Uruguay (Oriental Republic of Uruguay) </h2>

<p>
    Uruguay was born at the end of the Spanish colonial era in the South America as a result of the 18-years-long war for independence, which ended in <b>1828</b> by the <b>Treaty of Montevideo</b>. Country's relative small size and population, which had not exceeded 75 thousands people at the start of XIX century made it the military target of opportunity for neighboring giant states of Argentina and Brazil. On top of that, two predominant social classes in Latin America - agricultural and business - represented by two political parties - conservative <b>Blancos</b> and liberal <b>Colorados</b> - had clashed on the political and military arenas of Uruguay for the time period lasting up to the beginning of 1900th.
</p>
<p>
    The Colorado party had stayed in power in Uruguay for almost all of XX century, overseeing an economic boom of 1910th and the following depression in 1930th, a coup d'etat in 1933 and then again an economic uprising of 1950th (which was caused by sharp rise in the Korean War stimulated meat export), civil turmoils in 1960th led by the famous <b>Tupamaros</b> (the urban guerrilla movement, which one of members - <b>Jose Mujica</b> - later became the President of Uruguay) followed by the combined civil-military regime, which lasted up to <b>1985</b>.
</p>
<p>
    At the start of 1990th, when the great majority of post-dictatorial countries switched to the lesser-fair capitalism model, Uruguay tried something different. While liberalizing the economy, Uruguayan governments made an emphasis on improving the electoral system and providing people with social security, education as well as strengthened the public safety.
</p>

<p>
    Although this politics didn't stop the country from plunging into the deep recession at the start of 2000th, which was caused by the financial crisis in Brazil and Argentina, it prevented large scale social disturbances and the following drastic political shift to the right-wing, populist, nationalist, authoritarian type of government which later became the predominant future of other emerging countries in 2010th.
</p>
<p>
    As a result of implementation of such a model Uruguay enjoys one of the highest level of political stability coupled with one of lowest levels of corruption in the World. On the economic side, Uruguay today, driven by the influx of highly educated young people from other countries attracted by modern, open-minded social policies and the cosmopolitan culture of Montevideo, is gradually converting itself into the technological hub of the South America.

<p>
	At November 2017 "The Banco Central del Uruguay" (BCU) announced the launch of the national cryptocurrency. It said that a limited number of users would help testing a mobile app for the transfer of crypto. However, bank's officials soon followed with additional commentary stating that "it is not a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoins but a currency that remains the responsibility of the BCU".
</p>
<p>
	Despite all of those official ambiguities we may assume that Uruguayan regulators are generally disposed to adopt a reasonable, thoughtful approach to Internet money adaption in the country. Although there's no comprehensive crypto-law existing in Uruguay, both trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs are legal in this country.
