<h2 align = 'center'> Seychelles (Republic of Seychelles) </h2>

<p>
	Historically, Seychelloise economy had been largely based on coconuts (<i>coco de mer</i>) export. In 1971 the newly built airport drastically increased the number of international arrivals soon converting this island into the one of the most prestigious tourists destinations in the Eastern hemisphere.

	The international piracy had haunted Seychelles for decades. In 1980 the group of <b>43</b> mercenaries, led by the former member of Rhodesian SAS, tried to overthrow the socialist government of Seychelles. There were stopped on the custom, when their AK-47th were found in the false-bottomed luggage. However, fighting their way through the airport guards, they managed to hijack the Indian plane (the Flight 224) and escaped to South Africa.

	Seychellois socialism ended in <b>1993</b>, when, after the collapse of the USSR, the ruling party - <b>People's Progressive Front</b> (PL) - was forced to introduce the multi-party system. After September 2016 elections, PL holds on to 14 seats in the unicameral, 33-members National Assembly, while liberal "Seychelles National Party" (SNP) has 19 deputies.

	Seychelles doesn't have the developed technological industry and its population relies mostly on banking and tourists sectors for revenues. Local startup founders will have difficult time trying to scale their local businesses. Small economy, tiny population, high administrative and legal barriers, deficit of qualified personnel have negatively affected the growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem. At the same time, with the support from the government, local FinTech entrepreneurs may find the lucrative opportunity in the quickly growing global crypto-economy.

<p>
	In November 2016 the Seychelles Financial Services Authority (FSA) issued the warning over "fraudulent" Bitcoin investment scheme practiced by one of the unregistered tech companies. Besides that declaration FSA and the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) had kept silence on the subject of cryptocurrencies leaving operators in the grey legal area. Still, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs are legal in Seychelles.
