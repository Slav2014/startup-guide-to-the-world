    2-3 million tourists, which visit Sam Marino each year, contribute more than 50% to country's GDP. With per-capita income exceeding $40 thousands, citizens of San Marino enjoy one of the highest standards of living in Europe coupled with low taxes. At the same time, San Marino's tiny economy is not well-suited for ambitious tech startups. Local founders may do mush better aiming their marketing efforts at the neighboring Italian users.

	The Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino (CBSM), which is the main financial regulatory authorities in the country, has not yet expressed its position on digital currencies, leaving Bitcoin and other crypto in the gray legal zone. However, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are technically legal in Sam Marino. CBSM's official position on the matter will most likely be influenced by the Banca d'Italia.
