<h2 align = 'center'> Republic of Ireland </h2>

<p>
   The Constitutional Republic of Ireland, which is headed by the President-poet <b>Michael D.Higgins</b>, has traditional parliamentary system of governance. Its 60-members Senate (<b>Seanad Éireann</b>) and 158-members House of Representatives (<b>Dáil Éireann</b>) both are traditionally led by two nationalist parties: right-wing <b>Fine Gael</b> and left-wing <b>Fianna Fail</b>. Together they form the so-called "Irish <b>two-party system</b>". After <b>February 2016</b> elections pro-government "Fine Gael" holds on to 19 seats in the <i>Seanad</i> and 50 seats in the <i>Dáil</i>. "Fianna Fail" has, respectively, 14 and 44 deputies.

<p>
   From the mid-1990s to the late-2000s economy of the Republic of Ireland experienced a period of rapid economic growth, which was called the <b>Celtic Miracle</b>. However, following 2008 World's debts crisis, local small and under-capitalized banking sector went into the bankruptcy state, country's GDP plummeted and Ireland government's debts level rose to the record hight. Irish policymakers reacted by providing multiple tax and legal incentives to the innovative industries. As a result economic growth rate quickly recovered, reaching unprecedented 30% in 2016.

<p>
	In a relatively short time period Ireland has managed to build well-diversified, technologically driven economy, which today attracts entrepreneurs from all over the Europe. The fastest growing GDP in the EU area, high-income consumers, excellent telecommunication infrastructure, low corporate income tax, availability of seed financing and highly qualified work-force - all of those factors have contributed to the rapid expansion of the Irish startups ecosystem. However, still, small population and relatively tiny local economy cannot provide tech founders with sufficiently large markets. For that they must look outside of the country's borders.  
</p>

<p>
	Ireland has already acquired its first Bitcoin ATM, a bar and the native cryptocurrency ( Gaelcoin). However, still, virtual currencies remain unregulated in Ireland and has yet to be recognized as legal tender. Moreover, the Irish Central Bank has declared that it foresees a dual economy of digital currency and state based fiat currencies, which is an exemplary progressive stance compare to that of other EU financial regulators. Consequently, in the short-term, we do not expect any knee-jerking reactions to crypto from part of local finance system's gate-keepers. Meanwhile, both trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs stay legal in Ireland.
