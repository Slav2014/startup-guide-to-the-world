<p>
	Nauru, formerly known as the <i>Pleasant Island</i>, together with Makatea in French Polynesia and Banaba in Kiribati were three islands with largest deposits of phosphates in the Pacific ocean. As a result, in 1960th and 1970th, Nauru's per-capita reached the record's high.
</p>
<p>
	However, after more than 50 years of the intense exploitation those reserves have been fully depleted. The security fund, which had been earlier established to accumulate Nauru's excessive currency reserver, was spent by its adventurous managers to support various expensive projects, which had high-media profiles.
	Still for its sources of revenues Nauru's population rely on a financial industry, small-scale mining and government's jobs.
</p>
<p>
	Small economy, tiny population and extreme geographical isolation of this oceanic islet have made a technological entrepreneurship there economically infeasible. Politics in Nauru is individualized and political parties are absent there. 
</p>
<p>
	Nauru uses the Australian dollar as the legal tender and has no central bank. Accordingly, Nauru's financial authorities are likely to follow the Reserve Bank of Australia's guidances on crypto-currencies' regulations. Still, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs are both legal in Nauru.
