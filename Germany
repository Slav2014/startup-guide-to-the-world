<p>
	Germany has the over-complicated, <b>federal</b> system of governance. Its President is indirectly selected by the so-called <i>Convention</i> and its <b>Chancellor</b> is voted into the office by the popularly elected 709-members <b>Bundestag</b>. The upper chamber of Parliament - <b>Bundes<u>r</u>ag</b> - is made from 69 non-elected bureaucrats, which are delegated by the respective government of each of sixteen German states (Lander).
</p>
<p>
	After September 2017 elections German Parliament is marginally led (with 89 votes) by the CDU-CSU coalition of the center-left "<b>Christian Democratic Union</b>" (CDU), which holds to 200 seats, and the central-right "Christian Social Union in Bavaria" (CSU) with 46 deputies, joined by the center-left "Social Democratic Party of Germany" (153 seats). Parliamentary opposition is represented by the far-right "Alternative for Germany" (92 seats), liberal "The Free Democratic Party" (80 seats), populist, far-left "The Left" (69 seats) and "The Greens" (67 seats).

<p>
	Germany's roughly $4 trillion economy is currently the fifth biggest in the world. It's largely service based and provides plenty of business opportunities for tech founders in varieties of industries. In fact, Berlin is one of the hottest spots on the high-tech world map, hosting thousands of prominent EU startups. On the other hand, Germany, as many other European countries, possesses the stringent labor law and tough tax system, which notably limit the growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem.  
</p>
<p>
	Trading crypto and organizing ICOs are both legal in Germany. Moreover, Germany is one the most advanced countries when it comes to regulating virtual currencies. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) qualified cryptocurrencies as "units of account" and, therefore, financial instruments. BaFin stated that "units of account are comparable to foreign exchange with the difference that they do not refer to a legal tender". It allows digital cash to be used as legal currency for tax (to be taxed) and trading purposes.
</p>
<p>
	As to ICOs German regulators follows the guideline of The European Securities and Markets Authority which has stated, "Blockchain technology does not liberate users from the need to comply with the existing regulatory framework". It means that from the securities and regulatory perspective, the Banking Act, Investment Act, Securities Trading Act, Payment Services Supervision Act and Prospectus Acts are in force for all ICOs marketed on the territory of Germany.
