<p>
   Vanuatu unique political system was formed in <b>1906</b>, when France and United Kingdom tried to resolve their territorial disputes by the way of establishing the <b>Condominium</b>, or the French-British Coalition Government. In 1980, when Vanuatu gained its independence, it, however, kept the dual character of its legal and political system largely intact.

	Unicameral, 52-members Vanuatu Parliament consists of more than a dozen of small political groups and parties, each of which has on average 1-2 deputies. It makes Vanuatu politics highly personalized. P2P relationships play more important role there than political ideologies. One of the most contentious issues discussed in the Vanuatu Parliament is the distribution of budgets revenues among country's six provinces.

    Vanuatu has two famous cargo-cults: those of the American marine <b>John Frum</b> and of the spouse of Queen Elizabeth II <b>Prince Philip</b>.

	This small island nation, located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, doesn't have enough resources to maintain a viable startup ecosystem. Additionally, low-income consumers, relatively high costs of running tech business, which is explained by the extreme geographical isolation of those islands, an absence of seed capital and shortage of qualified personnel - all of those factors have imposed further constraints on local tech founders. However, some limited market opportunities could still be found in the growing sectors of international tourism and finance.

	In October 2017, according to the unconfirmed information, Vanuatu government started to accept Bitcoins as the legal form of payment. However, those rumors were later denied by local official representatives. Digital currencies stay in the gray legal zone in Vanuatu. Consequently, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs have remained technically legal in there.
