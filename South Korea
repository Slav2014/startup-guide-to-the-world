<h2 align = 'center'> Republic of Korea </h2>


<p>
    In XX century the Republic of Korea (ROK), economy of which had been destroyed by two consecutive wars (WW2 and the Korean War), managed to increase its GDP tenfold in less than 30 years. Experts named that <b>The Miracle on the Han River</b>.
</p>
<p>
     During that period ROK passed through several dictatorial regimes and coup d'etat. Only in early 1990th a discontent voice of the growing South Korean middle class had been heard by a local elite and the process of ROK political system democratization had began.
</p>
<p>
     Today South Korea is lead by its President and the 300-members, unicameral <b>National Assembly</b>, both elected on popular elections. The President appoints the prime minister and presides over the state council of chief ministers.</p>
<p>
    The list of main parliamentary parties in South Korea includes: left-wing <b>"Minjoo"</b> ("Together Party") with 121 deputies, right-wing, conservative <b>"Liberty Korea Party"</b> (former <b>"Saenuri"</b> or the "New Frontier"), which holds to 107 seats, and centrist <b>"Gungminui Dang"</b> ("People's Party") with 38 representatives in Parliament.

	South Korea is one of the most technologically advanced nations on Earth. It creates a number of business opportunities for startups in wide varieties of sectors. On the negative side, South Korean economy is closely controlled by the government, acting together with a small number of large corporations, which undermines the growth potentials for small and medium size enterprises as well as weakens the local startup ecosystem's long-term perspectives.

<p>
	South Korean regulators are gradually harshening the cryptocurrencies law, which is not surprising given the crucial role of government in regulating all spheres of economic activity in this country. 29 September 2017, South Korean financial regulators, following steps of its Chinese counterparts, banned ICOs. Still, Bitcoin and other digital currencies are technically legal in the country and local exchanges constitute the important part of World's crypto trading network. However, as popularity and price of Bitcoin increases we can expect further strengthening of South Korean regulations.
