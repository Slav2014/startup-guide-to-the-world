<h2 align = 'center'> Laos (Lao People's Democratic Republic) </h2>


<p>
    Lao re-established the monarchy after obtaining its independence from France in 1953. <b>Vietnam War</b> (1955 - 1975), during which US dropped on Laos more than <b>2.5 million tons of bombs</b>, became the turning point in country's modern history. In December 1975 the <b>Laotian Civil War</b> ended by local communist party, supported by Vietnam and USSR, proclaiming Lao the socialist state. Vietnam still plays a major role in Lao internal politics.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP)</b> is ruled by the "troyka" - Politburo, Secretariat and the Central Committee. It's the dominant political party in Lao, which President is, at the same time, the head of LPRP. In 149-members <b>National Assembly of Laos</b> 144 seats belong to LPRP, which makes Lao de-facto one-party communist state.

<p> 
    In 1990th, as a result of limited free-market reforms, a <b>private</b> entrepreneurship was allowed in the country. As a result, in the following decade Lao had managed to increase its agricultural production for more than 50%. Such industries as <b>hydroelectricity</b>, <b>tourism</b> and <b>mining</b> have been also growing very fast in this period. Lao GDP growth rate is still among the highest in the region (6-8%). 
</p>
<p>
	However, 80% of Laos population relies on subsistence agriculture, which constitutes 30% of GDP. On top of that, country's central authorities keep all major sectors of economy, including telecommunication, under their direct control. This does not create a healthy business climate for growth of small and medium enterprises in general and tech startups in particular. Startup ecosystem in Laos is centralized around the major, government controlled scientific institutions and its future perspectives are limited by ideology and bureaucratic red-tapes. On a positive side, growing economy and expanding supply of cheap, qualified workforce have created a number of niche market opportunities for local startup founders. 
</p>
<p>
	There aren't any specific laws in Laos regulating Bitcoin or crytocurrencies in general. That makes it technically legal to trade crypto or to organize a TGE in the country. However, it's not likely that the present state of affairs in this highly contentious sphere of finance will last long without major changes. Taking into the account over-conservative character of Lao banking authorities the long-term future of crypto in this country looks bleak.
