<h2 align = 'center'> Benin (Republic of Benin) </h2>


<p>
    The territory of the <b>Kingdom of Benin</b> (<b>1180</b> - <b>1897</b>) had covered the coastal territory of the present-day <b>Nigeria</b>. The <i>République du Bénin</i> (formerly <b>French Dahomey</b> and, later, the <i>Republic of Dahomey</i>) had gained its independence from France in 1960. It was re-named after the ancient kingdom in 1975. After-independence period (1960-1970th) was characterized by multiple coup d'etat.
</p>
<p>
	In <b>1972</b>, as a result of one of those coups,  the graduate of French military school - <b>Mathieu Kerekou</b> - had seized power in Benin and then ruled the country for the following <b>34</b> years. Despite an obviously autocratic nature of his regime, Kerekou managed to peacefully pass his authority to democratically elected government in 2006. Today <i>République du Bénin</i> is the presidential state where unicameral, 83-members <b>Assemblée nationale</b> is comprised of <b>12</b> small political parties, constantly forming multiple alliances.

<p>
    Regardless its successful transition from a dictatorship to an emerging Democracy Benin remains one of the poorest countries in the World with per capita less than $1000 and literacy rate under 30%.

	Binning economy is dominated by an agricultural sector and its population's disposable income level is low. Additionally, local infrastructure (including telecommunication) is in a dare state, administrative and legal barriers to SME are too high and seed and VC capitals are almost unavailable in the country. On a positive side, large, growing young population, absence of competition and low costs of running an e-business provide local tech founders with market opportunities in the mobile space.
</p>
<p>
	Cryptocurrencies are not an issue for Beninese authorities due to country's very low Internet penetration rate. Moreover, financial regulators, represented by "Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest" (BCEAO), have already demonstrated their tolerance towards crypto, when they didn't react to Senegal's decision to introduce their blockchain based national digital currency named eCFA. BCEAO plays the central bank's role for the eight west African countries - members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA): Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo. Those countries share the West African CFA franc.

    This name was first used in <b>1975</b> by country's Marxist government from ideological reasons. The goal was to erase from people's memories the inglorious past of that finger like stretch of land on the African Continent. In fact the ancient <b>Kingdom of Benin</b> existed on the coastal territory of present-day <b>Nigeria</b> for more than <b>700</b> years (from <b>1180</b> to <b>1897</b>) and has almost nothing to do with <i>Benin</i> as we know it today. 
</p>
<p>
    Similar to so many other African states what then became <i>République du Bénin</i> had been artificially established inside its current borders by European colonizers without any regards to African political and social heritages. In <b>1899</b> France assigned the name <b>French Dahomey</b> to it. In <b>1958</b> France allowed self-rule to the <i>Republic of Dahomey</i> and, then, 100% independence on <b>1 August 1960</b>.

</p>
<p>
    In pre-colonial period the coastal part of present-day Benin belonged to the <b>Kingdom of Dahomey</b>. Attracted by its strategic location alongside Atlantic Ocean shores and by deep water fjords which gave refuge for ocean ships <b>Portugal</b> adventurers came to Dahomey region looking for business as early as in <b>XV</b> century. Portuguese slave traders found in local kings very accommodating business partners and, in <b>1472</b> reached with them mutually satisfactory agreement.
 
</p>
<p>
    Local customs dictated that prisoners of war must be sacrificed on the Royal Court's parties. Sage  Kings, advised by shrewd and humane European gentlemen, realized that this ceremony was not only barbaric but also the waste of very valuable resources. For the next <b>300</b> years the <b>Slave Cost</b> - the name under which this region soon became known Worldwide - delivered up to 10,000 black slaves per annum to both of American continents.
</p>
<p>

    After-independence period (from 1960th to the mid 1970th) was a chain of coups and counter-coups for Dahomey. The graduate of French military school - <b>Mathieu Kerekou</b> - seized power in <b>1972</b> coup d'etat and for the next <b>34</b> years the history of <i>Dahomey-Benin</i> became closely linked to this colorful personage.
</p>
<p>
    In <b>1974</b> he introduced Dahomey to Marxism and changed country's name to <b>People's Republic of Benin</b> in <b>1975</b>. Soon after, probably, as a result of Marxist-Leninist theoretical insights, Benin took a first load of <b>nuclear waste</b> from the USSR and later from France. Colonial rule and socialists' genus had made Benin <i>one of the least developed countries on the African continent in 1970th</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Kerekou converted to <b>Islam</b> in <b>1980</b> and then to <b>born-again Christian</b>. In <b>1989</b> banking crisis erupted and Benin's army revolted. That was the sigh and Mr. Kerekou heard it load and clear. He renounced Marxism and embraced Capitalism. The new Constitution came to force and presidential elections were called in <b>1991</b> but Mr. Kerekou lost it. Here we should gave a credit to him because those elections became <i>the first case of blood-less transition of power in the African post-colonial history</i>. 
</p>
<p>
    Obviously, people of Benin appreciated this gesture very much because they re-elected charming and unpredictable Mr. Kerekou back to its post in <b>1996</b> where he stayed till <b>6 April 2006</b>. In <b>1999</b> he apologized for Africans participation in slave trade which came as an unprecedented step for an African leader at this time. 
</p>
<p>
    Today <i>République du Bénin</i> is the presidential state with Parliament - <b>Assemblée nationale</b> - comprised of <b>12</b> political parties. <i>Most of them are formed by leading political operatives of Benin and do not have clearly expressed ideological and political orientation.</i> 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Forces Cauris pour un Bénin Emergent</b> with 32 seats (jointly with <b>Alliance Amana</b> - AA), the opposition party - <b>L'Union fait la Nation</b> - with 15 seats and the party comprised from exiled Beninese - <b>Parti du renouveau démocratique </b> - with 10 seats have a major representation in <i>Assemblée</i>. <i>Today Benin is viewed by EU and USA Governments as a glaring example of successful transition from dictatorship to democracy in Africa.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Regardless its success as an emerging Democracy <i>Benin remains one of the poorest countries in the World with per capita less than $800 and literacy rate under 30%.</i> On top of that the latest reports from the country on corruption, nepotism and secret political deals led many observers to question the viability of Benin's government system.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Benin people are doing their best to get rid of their colonial, socialist and totalitarian heritages but it looks like this process is now stalled for a wile.</i>
