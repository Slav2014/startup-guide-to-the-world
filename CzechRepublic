<h2 align = 'center'> Czech Republic (Česká republika) </h2>

<p>
    In November <b>1989</b> the <b>Velvet Revolution</b> restored the democratic governance in <i>Czechoslovakia</i>. <b>1 January 1993</b> <i>Československo</i> had ceased to exist and two new states - <b>Czech Republic</b> and <b>Slovakia</b> - had appeared on the European map. In 1990th Czech Republic had completed the successful transition from the planned, state-run economy to the free market.

    After October 2017 elections, the lower house of the Czech Parliament - 200-members <b>Parlament České republiky</b> - contains 9 political parties the largest of which is the newly formed, populist "Action of Dissatisfied Citizens" (ANO), which holds to 78 seats. The second biggest parliamentarian party - conservative "Civic Democratic Party" (ODS) has 25 deputies. The former leading party - centrist <b>Česká strana sociálně demokratická</b> (ČSSD) - has now only 15 seats.

	The Czech Republic used to be one of the most technologically advanced countries in the former Soviet bloc and it had kept its status after the dissolution of USSR. Today the Republic has a developed startup ecosystem, which presents multiple business opportunities to local tech founders. On the negative side, rising costs of doing business, increasing competition and brain-drain to the neighboring Central European countries have reduced the growing potentials of Czech tech enterprises.

	Prior to January 2017 the Czech Republic had no had a law regulating digital currencies. However, after the Finance Ministry introduced an anti-money laundering law, cryptocurrency exchanges are required to determine the identity of their customers. Exchange must also pay state income tax calculating revenues from transactions by using the official exchange rate of the virtual currrencies. Overall those restrictions are mild compare to most other countries. Buying and selling Bitcoin as well as organizing ICOs are both legal in the Czech Republic and there are not indications that this regime will be changed in the nearest future.
