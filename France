<h2 align = 'center'> France (French Republic) </h2>

<p>
	France ranks fourth in the world in terms of its cumulative household wealth, which amounts to $250,000 per family. However, Paris's poorest <i>arrondissements</i>, together with the rest of the country, have been marginalized to the degree never seen in the past 20 years. On top of that, the Fifth Republic has been profoundly affected by the 2017 EU immigration crisis. Those factors have led to the drastic shift in the French political landscape during May 2017 presidential race and June 2017 elections into 577-members "Assemblée nationale".
</p>
<p>
	Newly formed pro-government, liberal "La République En Marche group (National Assembly)" dominates the lower chamber of French parliament with 313 deputies. The second most representative parliamentary party - the conservative, Gaullist "Groupe Les Républicains" - currently holds to 100 seats. Distant third place belongs to socially-minded "Groupe du Mouvement démocrate et apparentés" (47 seats). 
</p>
<p>
	France is one of the most export orientated countries in the World, with more than halve-a-trillion dollars of goods and serves crossing its borders each year. The bulk of it are going to its EU neighbors - Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain - closely followed by UK (7%) and USA (6%). 
</p>
<p>
	France's large consumer base, service-based economy, developed infrastructure, highly educated workforce and availability of seed and VC financing create a variety of business opportunities for tech founders. On the other hand, stringent labor laws, high taxes, growing competition and rising costs present a challenge for the multiple participants of the local startup ecosystem.

<p>
	Although trading digital currencies and organizing ICOs remain technically legal in France, national finance gate-keepers have seemed to be taken ill-informed approach to its regulation. The Bank of France representative said that, under the French law, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a legal currency. Moreover, its governor stated that the digital, "speculative" asset is not "even a cryptocurrency" (sic). "The Autorite des marches financiers" (AMF) announced that ICOs have no legal status under French law. The AMF president also stated that there are "various issues" relating to cryptocurrency. At the same time, French government officials said that although they do not officially recognize Bitcoin as a currency, they can still impose income taxes.
