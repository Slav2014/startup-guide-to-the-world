<h2 align = 'center'> Dominica (Commonwealth of Dominica) </h2>

<p>
    In 1632 Dominica was occupied by France. In 1763, after signing the <b>Treaty of Paris</b>, Britain established its presence on this Caribbean island. Dominica gained its independence only in 1978. It had been followed by the prolonged period of the political instability. In 1979 and 1980 local population hardships were exacerbated by the distractions caused by several hurricanes.

<p>
    Current Dominican system of government is based on the Westminster system. Unicameral, 32-members House of Assembly is dominated by the left-wing <b>Dominica Labor Party</b>, which holds to 15 seats. The opposition is lead by the centrist United Worker's Party with 6 deputies.

    Economically Dominica heavily relies on offshore banking and banana export. In an attempt to diversify the local economy Dominican government actively supports coffee and citruses producers. Another growing sector on the island is an ecological tourism. On top of that, the citizenship-for-money program is enacted in Dominica.

	Dominican developed finance industry and its growing tourism sector present some limited market opportunities for local tech entrepreneurs. Island's tiny population of low-income consumers, stagnating economy, high legal and administrative barriers to SME, shortage of qualified personnel and geographical isolation have significantly undermined the growth potential of the Dominican startups ecosystem.

	Although the plan (named "Bit Drop") to distribute Bitcoins to all Dominican inhabitants and to convert Dominica into the first Bitcoin nation on the planet was discontinued in 2014, this small island state still remains friendly to digital cash. At the same time, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which is the monetary authority for a group of eight island economies including <b>Commonwealth of Dominica</b>, does not recognize Internet currencies as the legal tender. Still, buying and selling cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are legal in Dominica. In a future, the official position of ECCB on cryptocurrencies is likely to be influenced by USA financial regulators.
