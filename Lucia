<h2 align = 'center'> Saint Lucia </h2>


<p>
	The strategic position of Saint Lucia on the main trade route, which connects Europe and South America, has shaped its history in the most decisive fashion. During the period of 300 years St. Lucia passed from hands of French fleet commanders to those of British for more than <b>dozen</b> times. As a result, St. Lucia's government structure presents itself an amalgam of the Westminster system and the Napoleonic code.
</p>
<p>
	Santa Lucia gained its independence from UK on 1 March 1967. Since that time two main Lucia's political parties - the centrist <b>United Workers Party</b> and the left-wing <b>Saint Lucia Labor Party</b> - have been dominant on the local political scene. Saint Lucia's Parliament includes 11-members <b>Senate</b> and 17-members <b>House of Assembly</b>. The head of the majority parliamentary party is also acting as the country's prime minister. 
</p>
<p>
	All of XXth century St. Lucia's economy was the three-legs stool: <b>tourism, oil and banana</b>. However, in 2010th, the increased competition from part of other Caribbean and Central American states led local banana industry to its demise. That was soon followed by the falling oil prices, which quickly suppressed the local oil export. Today the tourism industry is the sole growth factor of the nation's GDP.
<p>
</p>
	Local politicians are hard press to find alternative sources of revenues to fill up country's empty cash-box. As a result such projects as the <b>Passport Program</b>, under the conditions of which Lucia's citizenship is traded to foreign investments, has been put forward. However, this programs still remains one of the most contentious issues of Lucia's parliamentary debates. 
</p>
<p>
	Saint Lucia with its tiny population and small economy is not a promising land for high-tech entrepreneurs. Still, growing tourist sector and mid-income consumers provide niche markets opportunities for daring startup founders.
</p>
<p>
	St. Lucia doesn't have laws regulating crypto-currencies. Moreover, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which is the central bank for the Eastern Caribbean dollar and the monetary authority for the members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, including St. Lucia, hasn't yet officially expressed its position on digital money. Those factors have made trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs legal and sound in Saint Lucia.
