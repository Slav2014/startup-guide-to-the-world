<p>
	After May 2016 elections Filipino low-chamber of the national Parliament - 297-members "Kapulungan ng mga Kinatawan ng Pilipinas", which is also called "Batasan" - is dominated by the far-left, pro-government "Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan" (PDP–Laban) headed by the country's current president Rodrigo Duterte. PDP-Laban holds on to 123 seats, while the biggest opposition party - the right-wing " Nationalist People's Coalition" - has only 33 deputies.
</p>
<p>
	Liberal forces in the parliament is represented by the "Partido Liberal ng Pilipinas" with 27 seats. However, the patronage politics, or the "Padrino System", usually prevails in Batasan over ideological differences and encourages deputies to aligns itself with the party of the acting president.

	Philippines economy has been growing with a record peace for almost three decades in a row, mainly thanks to the large, qualified, low-paid work-force employed by the international corporations. Despite that, this country still lags behind its neighbors. The <b>manufacturing</b> sectors accounts for more than a halve of country's GDP. However, the technological industry is underrepresented in Philippines, which undermines the growth potentials of the local startups ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
	Philippines has been running the <b>large annual trade deficit (around 2 billion monthly)</b> thanks in part to the necessity to export most of its <b>rough materials</b> from Taiwan, <b>oil</b> from Saudi Arabia and <b>electronic products</b> from China. As a whole the Philippines economy looks sufficiently healthy, although over-relying on foreign exports and lacking competitive dynamic in its technological sector.

<p>
	It is legal to use cryptocurrencies in the Philippines. However, local authorities tries to closely supervised and regulate this area. The Central Bank of the Philippines has released BSP Circular N 944 entitled "Guidelines for Virtual Currency Exchanges", to provide guidelines on the legality of crypto-exchanges. BSP clarified that digital money will still not be considered a currency since it is neither issued or guaranteed by a central bank nor backed by any commodity. Filipino virtual exchanges are required to register with the "Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas" (BSP) as a Foreign Exchange Dealer (FXD), Money Changer (MC) and Remittance Agent (RA). Furthermore, other businesses who want to engage in crypto transfer needs to get registered with the BSP.
