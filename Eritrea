<h2 align = 'center'> Eritrea (State of Eritrea) </h2>


<p>
	Ancient Greeks called the Red Sea <i>erythra thalassa</i>. Today it's widely believed to be the etymology of Eritrea's name. This 120 square kilometers country, bordering Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, is also often cold the 'North Korea of Africa'. Eritrea is one of few countries in the world which still, after 25 years passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is engaged into the 'red', socialist experimentations over its peoples.
</p>
<p>
	Eritrea is one-party state, with centralized economy, an absence of independent medias and a disproportionately oversize military, where many Eritreans are obliged to stay for up to 30 years in a raw. At the mid-20th century Eritrea was in the federation alliance with Marxist-Leninist Ethiopia and became one of the central points for the proxy wars of this era. 
</p>
<p>
	Similar to North Korea, which still can't live trough its post-war traumas and abandon the mentality of besieged fortress, Eritrea's elite holds to power by eliminating political alternatives to its ruling party - <b>People's Front for Democracy and Justice</b> - and by perpetuating the state of social and economic crises blamed on external, subversive forces.
</p>
<p>
	As a result Eritrea, with its six million population generating no more than six billion dollars a year, is now one of the least developed countries in the World.
</p>

<p>
	Launching a tech startups in Eritrea although possible is out-of-this-world type of experience. With a record low Internet penetration and the government there executing tight control over economic activity of the population, it's difficult to imagine how a startup (even if allowed by authorities to exist) may scale without some local bureaucrat executing a "patronage" over the venture.
</p>
<p>
	Impoverished population doesn't provide a sustainable financial base for a protracted business growth. Besides, the shortage of qualified personnel, outdated IT infrastructure and multiple "red-tapes" do not create a nourishing ground for even the simplest startup ecosystem. Not to mention that seed money is almost nowhere to find in Eritrea.
</p>
<p>
	There are two most promising market niches on this country's rudimentary e-market: Internet commerce and advertisements. The level of competition in Eritrea is negligible, its economy is expanding and, providing, that even minor economic and political reforms are implemented, a new tech company future growth's potential is huge from such low starting base.
</p>

<p>
	....
	The Bank of Eritrea via a legal notice gazetted on October 25 limited the amount of Nakfa (the national currency) that can be taken outside the country. The notice says no traveler leaving Eritrea can take out more than a thousand Nakfa, about 65 dollars, and those under 18 cannot take any money at all.
