<h2 align = 'center'> Ethiopia (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) </h2>


<p>
    It's one of the oldest states on the Black Continent and it's the one which has stayed independent for the duration of almost all of its history (short of the brief period from 1936 to 1941). Ethiopia had long lived under the umbrella of so many different cultures, religions and ideologies. It used to be one of the closest allies of USSR in Africa. Today Ethiopia is the largest Christian country on the African continent.
</p>
<p>
    It's also one the World's fastest growing economies. Still, Ethiopia is one of the poorest countries on Earth. From almost 100 million people living today in Ethiopia more than 25 million is under the poverty line. Agriculture is the major source of income for almost 80% of country's population. Coffee beans is the major locally grown crop. As in the ancient past, a major drought is still capable to cause sudden famine outbreak in Ethiopia.

    Ethiopian history goes back to the dawn of human civilization. 'Ethiopia' (which means 'burned face' in ancient Greek) is mentioned in 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey'. Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut organized the expedition to the Land of Punt (Egyptian name for Ethiopia) in XIV century B.C. Multiple generations of indigenous kings and queens ruled Ethiopian for hundreds of years. At March 1, 1896 Ethiopian army defeated Italy in the Battle of Adwa. In 1936 Benito Mussolini's infantry had entered Ethiopia, which, for a short time period, became a part of the fascist state (until Britain crushed Italy during the East African Campaign in 1941).

    From 1970th to the beginning of 1990th, Ethiopia, as, officially, the socialist state, was heavily influenced by Soviet Union's "anti-imperialist" politics in the region. In 1990th Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist experiment had resulted in the economic collapse, which was followed by the wide-spread social unrests. As the Soviet state disintegrated, Ethiopia transitioned to the new, democratic political system. However, <b>Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front</b> (EPRDF) has been overwhelmingly dominant on the local political arena for all those years. There are no opposition parties' members in the country's parliament - the <b>House of People's Representatives</b>. Currently, every single one of <b>547</b> seats in the House belongs to EPRDF or its allies.

    All of key Ethiopian industries such as telecommunications, retail, transport and finance remain under the strict central government's control. The fastest developing industry in the country is gold mining.

	Ethiopia is a white spot on the map of high-tech entrepreneurship. This country of more 100 million people had been self-isolated for a quarter of century from the information revolution. As the result, at mid-2010th, government owned telecommunication corporation of Ethiopia (an absolute monopolist in this country) publicly praised itself for making a nearest stationary telephone post available for every citizens in a radius of 5 km (reducing it from previous 7).

<p>
	Not-so-long-time ago smart-phones (as well as all other types of cell-phones) had required government's authorization to buy. You couldn't bring them into Ethiopia without special permission as well. Today, it reduces mobile devices usage to about 15% of population. Internet penetration rate in that more than one-millions-square-kilometers-sized country stays under 4%. All communication traffics there are closely monitored.
</p>
<p>
	Registering and running a private enterprise in Ethiopia is hard, to say the least, but profiting from a local Internet startup is almost heroic. There's no credit cards, electronic money or mobile payments allowed there.
</p>
<p>
	Although the local rate of economic expansion is one of the highest in Africa (almost 10%), this growth is achieved by rapid deployment of large international corporations' businesses (jointly with local government) in manufacturing and mineral extraction industries. 
</p>
<p>
	On the positive side, Ethiopia remains one of the few unexplored markets for high-tech startup founders. If some of them (there have been appearing more and more of those lately) manage to survive harsh present times, they can have all of this tremendously promising market only for themselves in a future.
