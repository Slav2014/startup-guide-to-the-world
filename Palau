<h2 align = 'center'> Palau (Republic of Palau) </h2>

<p>
	US government sacrificed lives of more than 2,000 of its citizens when, during the World War II, it fought Japan in the Battle of Peleliu. In 1947 Palau was made a part of the Trust Territory of Pacific Islands by Washington. In 1981 this Trust was remodeled to the <b>Compact of Free Association</b> but it was ratified by Palauans themselves only in 1994.
</p>
<p>
	Palau is a democratic, non-party state, where politics is done by individuals with high informal ranks withing Palauan society. This social discourse is rooted in the local traditional culture, which values family and tribe over political ideologies.
</p>
<p>
	In 1998 special legislative act, passed by the US Senate, converted Palau into the offshore zone. However, still, two major pillars of Palauan economy are agriculture and government services, which employ more than one third of islanders.
</p>
<p>
	Palau with its small, relatively wealthy population presents itself the compact and none-scalable market for startup founders. Launching a high-tech company in Palau is both time consuming and costly for a variety of reasons, including high administrative barriers, legal hurdles and a shortage of qualified personnel. However, some niche market opportunities can be found in building mobile FinTech applications for real estate, transport and tourism industries.
</p>
<p>
	In Palau, there is no specific law concerning crypto-currencies. Therefor, trading crypto and organizing ICOs are both technically legal in there. Palau uses the US dollar as legal tender and has no central bank. Consequently, Palau financial regulators are likely to follow steps of their USA counterparts with regards to an up-coming regulation of digital economy.
