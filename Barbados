<p>
	Barbados is a rare example of the Caribbean state, which doesn't have the developed offshore banking industry. Instead, alongside the tourist sector, which accounts for almost 50% of country' GDP, Barbados hosts multiple data processing centers, most of which are rented by international insurance corporations. However, as the average salary on the island continues to rise the growing number of tech companies have already moved their large data computing facilities outside of Barbados.

	A tech startup companies in Barbados experience major difficulties in scaling their local businesses faced by the small market, limited access to qualified coders and the chronic absence of venture financing. On the other hand, Barbados government actively supports the local startup ecosystem both politically and financially.
</p>
<p>
	However, the result of those efforts are mixed. On the one hand, Barbados stands out among other Caribbean states by the number of official organizations supporting innovations. On the other, the number of local startups has been increasing too slowly and, after more than 5 years of continuous efforts from part of the government, still stays almost negligible.

	The Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) has been playing with an idea of adapting cryptocurrencies to its use for quite a while. In December 2015 CBB hinted that Bitcoins may be added to its foreign currency reserves. In April 2016 a bank's representative stated that CBB is willing to test the idea to put Barbadian Dollars, which is currently pegged to USA dollar in a proportion two-to-one, on the blockchain. Still digital currencies stay unregulated in Barbados, which makes trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs technically legal there.
