<p> 
	After the end of Word War Two Japanese political system was re-designed by General Douglas A. MacArthur's staff officers with active participations of the Allies bureaucrats, which applied the Western good practices to the Japanese post-Imperial realities.
</p>
<p>
	As a result, today Japan has the Constitution, which was written by USA congressmen, the Parliament, which status is based on the Westminster standard, the centralized administrative apparatus, which reminds the one created by Napoleon Bonaparte in XIX century for French <i>citoyenne</i>, and the legal code (<b>Six Codes</b>), which is largely based on the Roman-Dutch law.
</p>
<p>
	After October 2017 elections Japanese low-chamber of the Parliament - 465-members <b>National Diet</b> - is dominated by the pro-government, right-wing nationalist, 62-years-old <b>Liberal Democratic Party</b> (LDP), which holds to 283 seats. The second-largest liberal opposition party - <b>Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan</b> - has only 54 deputies.

<p>
	Japan, which currently possesses the third-largest economy in the World, provides tech startup founder with multiple business opportunities in a variety of sectors. However, the low GDP rate, which has haunted Japan for more than three decades in a row, as well as rigid legal system, over-regulated financial sphere, inflexible labor codex and the predominance of big corporations in tech industry have significantly undermined the growth potentials of the local startups ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
	In April 2017, Japan passed a law recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender on its territory. It made Japan the first country in the World to officially enter the new era of digital money. This position stays in a sharp contrast to the recent China's cracks down on crypto, and set Japan as the powerhouse of the cryptocurrency market.
