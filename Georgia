<p>
	In October 1917 Georgia had briefly gained its independence as the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. However, in February 1921, Bolsheviks Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a dictatorship of workers' and peasants'. In 1991 Georgia, after the disintegration of the USSR, became the democratic semi-presidential republic with the President as the head of state, and Prime Minister as the head of government. The following economic crisis caused civil unrests and military conflicts, which lasted for the most part of 1990th.

	The "Rose Revolution" of 2003 brought into Georgia the new era of liberal reforms. 2008 World's financial crises accompanied by the August War with Russia led to new wave of the economic and political turmoils culminated by October 2012 election when conservative "Georgian Dream â€“ Democratic Georgia", headed by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, won the majority of seats in the the unicameral, 150-members "Sakartvelos Parlament". Still, after the most recent October 2016 elections, "Georgian Dream" holds to 115 seats, while the second largest parliamentary party - pro-European "Movement for Liberty" - has only 21 deputies.

	Despite the continuing and partially successful  attempts of central government to improve Georgian investments and business climates its relatively small economy is still largely based on subsistence agriculture and international remittances. Coupled with low-income consumers and rising unemployment it negatively affects the growth perspectives of the local startup ecosystem. On the positive side, steadily growing GDP and expanding base of mobile Internet users have created a number of local business opportunities for daring tech founders.

	Georgia is the Bitcoin-friendly state. In February 2017 Georgia become one of the first countries in the world to implement the distributed ledger platform into government services. The Republic of Georgia's National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) signed an agreement to use the blockchain to verify property transactions. The National Bank of Georgia provides local financial companies with license, which, among other things, allows the organization "to process Bitcoin or its very own crypto currency." However, although trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs both are technically legal in Georgia, this sphere still remains widely unregulated.
