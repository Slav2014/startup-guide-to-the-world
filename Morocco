<h2 align = 'center'> Morocco (Kingdom of Morocco) </h2>


<p>
    Morocco regained its independence in <b>March 1956</b> when it became the Kingdom. The modernization reform of early 2000th, initiated by Mohammed VI, was intended to bring the local political system closer to the European standards of the constitutional monarchy.

<p>
    After October 2016 elections the lower chamber of Morocco Parliament 325-members <b>Majlis an-Nuwwâb</b> (The Assembly of Representatives of Morocco) is dominated by the government coalition headed by the 50-years-old, right-wing, nationalist <b>Justice and Development Party</b> or PJD, which holds to 125 seats. The largest opposition party - the monarchist <b>Parti authenticité et modernité</b> or PI (The Authenticity and Modernity Party) - has 102 deputies. Since 1975 the <b>Western Saharan</b> has been one of the most contentious issues of Morocco internal and external political debates.

    Without taking into account the impact of oil industry on GDP, Morocco has the second largest economy in Africa (after the Egypt) with expanding tourism, agriculture, mining, construction, textile and telecoms sectors. Additionally, Morocco is one of the main world's centers of the cannabis production. Still, due to a large and growing population Morocco's per capita remains very low.

<p>
    Moroccan startup ecosystem is negatively affected by gradually slowing economy, very high unemployment rate, low income consumers, high administrative and legal barriers as well as a deficit of seed and VC financing. At the same time, the growing number of young, urban users of mobile Internet provide local tech founders with multiple business opportunities in different sectors.  
</p>
<p>
	On November 2017 Foreign Exchange Office of Morocco (Office des Changes) and Bank Al-Maghrib published a statement, promising to penalize anyone transacting with foreign countries without going through authorized government intermediaries or in foreign currencies not listed by Bank Al-Maghrib. That effectively makes trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs illegal in Morocco.
