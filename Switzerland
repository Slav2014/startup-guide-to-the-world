<p>
	Since 1959 the <i>"magic formula"</i> of Swiss most efficient in the World direct democracy had been: <i>2 CVP, 2 SPS, 2 FDP and 1 SVP</i> or 2-2-2-1. It has recently been changed to 1-2-2-2.  
</p>
<p>
    Today Switzerland is governed by the <b>Federal Council</b>, which is elected for four consecutive years and composed by seven representatives of four major parties:
    <li>centrist <b>Christlichdemokratische Volkspartei der Schweiz</b> or CVP (Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland) - 1 seat;</li>
    <li>left-wing <b>Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz</b> or SPS (Swiss Socialist Party) - 2 seats;</li>
    <li>right-wing <b>Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei</b> or FDP (Free Democratic Party) - 2 seats;</li>
    <li>nationalist <b>Schweizerische Volkspartei</b> or SVP (Swiss People's Party) - 2 seats.</li>
</p>
<p>
     Bicameral, 246 seats <b>Bundesversammlung</b> includes <b>Standerat</b> (46 seats) and <b>Nationalrat</b> (200 seats). Pro-government parties hold on in Nationalrat to 168 seats with opposition, led by "Greens", represented by 32 deputies.

    Switzerland's well-diversified economy hosts World's leading companies in such industries as watches making, military equipments production, food, banking and tourism. Developing science and technologies sector has been the main priority of Switzerland's economic policy for centuries. 113 Nobel Laureates winners stand in relation to Switzerland. Swiss startups ecosystem is steadily growing despite recent economic downturn, which brought country's GDP yearly growth rate down from 4-5% in 2008 to under 1% in 2017.

	In Switzerland cryptocurrencies are not only being legitimized but also encouraged to grow.	The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has issued a license to several local banks to manage assets based on the blockchain technology such as bitcoin and other digital currencies. On the state level Switzerland has adopted the so-called ‘sandbox’ approach, which specifies several regions, where startups can experiment within controlled conditions.
</p>
<p>
	The famous example of that is the tiny Swiss town Zug, located in 20 miles south of Zurich, nicknamed "Crypto Valley", where such companies as Ethereum and Xapo are registered. Another example is the municipality of Chiasso, which intends to accept tax payments in Bitcoin.
</p>
<p>
	Swiss Finance Ministry has also promises to re-evaluate banking legislation to allow smaller companies in financial technology to obtain licenses. In short, Swiss regulators are not trying to fit digital currencies into the old, and often outdated, legal frameworks. Instead they approach them as they would the new, innovative financial services.
