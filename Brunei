<h2 align = 'center'> Brunei (Nation of Brunei, Abode of Peace) </h2>


<p>
    Brunei had been a sovereign state until 1888, when it was conquered by Britain. Brunei regained its independence in 1959.

    Oil was discovered in Brunei in 1929, when it was literally <i>smelled</i> by two European travelers near <b>Seria</b> river. Since then oil has served as a single engine motor of Brunei's economy. <b>Brunei Shell Petroleum</b> (owned 50/50 by the Brunei Government and Royal Dutch/Shell) produces 170,000 barrels of 'black gold' every day. At the same time, Brunei imports most of consumers products, including food. For example, Brunei government runs one of the largest chicken farms in Australia. Its land area exceeds that of Brunei.

    Brunei is the absolute monarchy with the constitutional elements. Sultan is the head of State. Brunei Government is made of four Councils: the Privy (rules on constitutional matters), Succession (if asked, determines the succession of sultans), Religious (settles religious disputes) and Ministers (day-to-day state's administration). However, the power of those councils are secondary to Sultan's. Brunei has a legal system, which is based on English common law and, at the same time, recognizes the Sharia.

	Brunei is one of the richest nations in the region with highly developed infrastructure and good investment climate, which creates an appropriate environment for the development of the local startup ecosystem. However, heavy economic reliance on oil export, absence of manufacturing industries, small population, administrative barriers and deficit of qualified work-force have served as major impediments to local high-tech businesses growth. Still, an active support of Islamic finances by Brunei authorities may provide an incentive for local FinTech startup founders.

<p>
	The Monetary Authority of Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) does not recognize digital currencies as a legal tender. At the same time, selling and buying crypto as well as using blockchain technology for other purposes, such as to issue smart contracts, shares (including ICOs), coupons, voting system etc., are still legal in Brunei. It's difficult to predict how long this regulatory void will last. However, given that the Brunei economy heavily relies on exported goods and services, we believe that over-regulating Internet currencies is not likely to improve the stability of Brunei Dollar (BND). Therefore we may expect the current regime to continue for a while.
