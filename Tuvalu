<h2 align = 'center'> Tuvalu </h2>


<p>
	The global warming is one the major priorities for Tuvaluans. The islands' highest elevation point is less than five meters above the sea level. It makes Tuvalu one of the first places on Earth to be engulfed by the rising ocean.
</p>
<p>
	Tuvaluan economy heavily relies on payments for fishing rights received from international companies. Tourism industry is almost absent in Tuvalu due to its extreme geographical remoteness. As the result, the number of employed Tuvaluans is reduced to three-four thousands. Central government remains the major source of local jobs. Regular budget deficit is covered by the US.
</p>
<p>
	Formally, tech economy contributes almost 10% to Tuvaluan GDP. Lease payments for the popular domain name "tv" brings in around $2.5 million a year to the local budget. However, Tuvalu has very limited (if any) technology potentials. Lack of industries, tiny population, absence of qualified personnel, low wages and geographical isolation have made Tuvalu the least desirable destination for tech founders. Additionally, Tuvaluan telecom providers use pricey satellites connections, which significantly increases the Internet costs for end-users.
</p>
<p>
	Tuvaluan regulatory system is based on the British law, which creates a better regulatory climate for tech entrepreneurs compare to neighboring Pacific states. However, under the present political, economic, social and demographic conditions the local startups ecosystem is lacking important incentives for grows.
</p>
<p>
	There is no central monetary authority or central bank in Tuvalu. The National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) carries out some monetary functions for the government and provides banking services for population. However, the Tuvaluan dollar is not an independent currency, and it's pegged to the Australian dollar.
</p>
<p>
	NBT hasn't yet expressed its opinion on cryptocurrencies and trading digital cash as well as organizing ICOs both are technically legal in Tuvalu. However, there's a little doubts that, if necessary, NBT will at any time aling its official position on crypto with that of the Reserve Bank of Australia.
