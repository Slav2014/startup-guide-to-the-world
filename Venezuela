<p>
	The <b>United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV)</b> dominates Venezuelan government. At the same time, after December 2015 elections, unicameral, 167-members <b>Asamblea Nacional</b> is led by the opposition alliance, which holds to 112 seats. Pro-government coalition is represented by PSUV with 52 deputies joined by two minor Parliamentary parties. However, the fact that <b>Mesa de la Unidad Democratica</b> (the Democratic Unity Roundtable) have gained the majority in Asamblea haven't changed the economic situation in the country. Clashes of angry demonstrators with police on <b>Caracas</b> streets are only intensifying as Venezuelan standards of living continue to deteriorate.

	Protracted global oil prices slump keeps Venezuelan economy under the severe pressure, sending it into the prolonged recession, exacerbated by political and social crisis. Heavily regulated markets, which are largely dependent on the overpowering government's presence in all major branches of the economy, do not create necessary prerequisites for the organic development of the startup ecosystem. On the other hand, such crumbling systems with ineffective, highly centralized bureaucratic apparatus, often produce a number of unexpected market opportunities in the areas not covered by government's dictates and outdated legislation.

	Venezuelan government, which, officially, has not legislated against cryptocurrencies, instead, had been persecuting Bitcoin miners, with police arresting them on false charges. State representatives argue that the cost of electricity, which is subsidized by the socialist government, weights too heavily on the budget. Still, trading crypto and organizing ICOs are technically legal in Venezuela. It's, however, unlikely that under present economic conditions the financial authorities, including "Banco Central de Venezuela" (BCV) and "Superintendencia de Bancos y Otras Instituciones Financieras", have sufficient resources to effectively regulate digital currencies.
