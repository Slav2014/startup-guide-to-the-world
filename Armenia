<p>
	After gaining its independence in September 1991 Armenia made dramatic U-turn from being a provincial state of former Soviet Union to a semi-presidential representative democratic republic. Country's Parliament - 105-members <b>Azgayin Zhoghov</b> - by two political parties: pro-government, nationalist <b>Republican Party of Armenia</b> (RPA), which holds to 58 seats, and pro-Russian <b>Prosperous Armenia Party</b> (PAP) which has 31 deputies. One of the most contentious issues of the contemporary Armenian politics is the resolution of armed conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabah region.

	Armenian small-sized, energy deficient, remittances dependent economy, low-income consumers, cumbersome legal system and shrinking, aging industrial sector are unable to sustain internationally competitive startups ecosystem. At the same time, fast growing mobile penetration rate and rapidly increasing number of young smart-phone users provide multiple niche-business opportunities for local tech founders.
</p>
<p>
	In 2014 the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia informed its citizens that "virtual currencies, including Bitcoins are not considered electronic money" and advised them not to use crypto under any circumstances "given the absence of clear-cut approaches on this issue in international practice". However, this opinion of local finance gate-keepers haven't been converted yet in the restrictive regulatory acts. Meanwhile, trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs stay legal in Armenia.
