<p>
    After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990th, the level of living in Hungary had drastically decreased, which soon led to communists politicians' come-back to government. The <b>Magyar Szocialista Párt</b> (MSZP) had dominated Hungarian political scene until 2010, when <b>Viktor Orban</b>'s nationalists <b>Fidesz – Magyar Polgári Szövetség</b> won 114 seats, or more than two-third, in the unicameral, 199-members <b>Országgyűlés</b>. The largest opposition party - "Unity" (Összefogás) - holds on to 28 seats only.

    Hungary has the well-diversified economy, with such industries as food processing, electronics, motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and tourism constituting the main part of country's gross product. Hungary also possesses a large agricultural sector, with agricultural lands taking more than 50% of Hungarian territory. Hungarian GDP growth rate is about 3%. At the same time, the unemployment rate, which had dropped from 11% in 2008 to 9% in 2017, still causes many young, qualified Hungarians to leave the country in a search for better life opportunities abroad.

	 Hungary used to be not only one of the breadbaskets of the former Socialists Block but also its leader in electronic productions. Still, it has managed to keep its leading positions in those areas in Western Europe. It creates a plethora of market opportunities for local startup founders in technological sphere. On the other side, a rising unemployment, specifically among younger generation, increasing competition from neighboring countries as well as high legal and administrative barriers have reduced local startup ecosystem growth perspectives.

	Despite the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) crack down on OneCoin in May 2017 and multiple warnings it had issued, calling the digital currencies payment method "much riskier" than other electronic payment options such as credit cards, MNB stance on cryptocurrencies seems to be much less extreme than that demonstrated by other country's financial regulators. However, MNB future decisions on the matter of the digital cash may mostly depends on the European Union actions. Meanwhile, buying and selling Bitcoin as well as organizing ICOs are legal in Hungary.
