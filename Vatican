<h2 align = 'center'> Vatican City (Vatican City State) </h2>

<p>
	Vatican City State came into being in <b>1929</b> after Pope Pius XI and the leader of the <i>National Fascist Party</i> - <b>Benito Mussolini</b> - signed the <i>Lateran Treaty</i> between the Holy See and Italy. This accord granted to the Catholic Church the full ownership and sovereign authority over 44 hectares of land, located within the Rome city's limits.

	The Vatican City state is one of the few remaining World's absolute monarchies. This monarchy is not hereditary and his ruler is elected by cardinals. The <i>Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State</i>, which consists of cardinals appointed by Pope, exercises a full legislative authority within a holy realm. Executive power belongs to the President of that commission. Everyone of a thousand Rome's citizens is one of high positioned Catholic church's bureaucrats, which are personally assigned to his/ her post by Pope.

	The officially recognized constituents of Vatican's GDP are trades of tourist memorabilia, museums' fees and books sales. However, the main engine of Holy See's economy is the infamous <i>"Istituto per le Opere di Religione"</i> (IOR), a.k.a. the Vatican Bank, which business among other things included participating in international tax evasions schemes and providing more than $1.4 billion in unsecured loans to Latin American dictators. Today, largely thanks to the world-wide activity of IOR, subjects of Vatican City State, which per-capita exceeds $400,000, enjoy the highest standards of living on the planet.

	Independent and well-informed observers have already recognized the existence of Holy See's long-term and intimate relationships with foreign currencies. Now it also includes crypto. In April 2016 Vatican City was rumored to introduce the first sovereign decentralized crypto-currency. Those plans, however, remain unfulfilled. Still, due to the absence of legal acts regulating this sphere, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs is legal in Vatican.
