<h2 align = 'center'> Singapore (Republic of Singapore) </h2>

<p> 
    Singapore gained its independence on <b>August 1965</b> not as the result of a popular uprising or a military coup but after <b>Malaysian Parliament</b> had voted 126-0 for the separation of Singapore. Soon after the architect of Singaporean miracle <b>Lee Kuan Yew</b> said: <i>"For me, it is a moment of anguish."</i>. In the next 50 years Singapore had been transformed from a dilapidated port-city into one of the wealthiest countries on Earth.
</p>
<p>
    Formally, Singapore is a parliamentary democracy with the <b>Prime Minister</b> and Cabinet members appointed by the <b>President</b>, which is elected on a popular elections. In practice, however, Singaporean political system may be characterized as a "hybrid", which includes some elements of typical autocracies, including one-party-rule.
</p>
<p>
    Unicameral, 101-members Singaporean Parliament is dominated by center-ring, liberal "People's Action Party" (PAP), which holds to 83 seats. Left-wing "Workers' Party" (WP) has 9 seats and there are, also, 9 of so-called Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), which are appointed by the President.

	Singapore economy's orientation on producing high-tech goods and services creates a fitting environment for startup founders. On the other hand, after the outbreak of 2008 financial crisis Singapore's services sector driven growth had slowed down significantly. Additionally, rising costs and increasing competition from neighboring Chinese, Malaysian and Indonesian tech hubs have had a downward pressure on the local startup ecosystem growth.
</p>
<p>
	Perhaps not surprisingly, given Singaporean progressive views on economic liberties, that local authorities approach to digital currencies is to include crypto into the existing finance and tax system. In February 2014, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) issued tax guidelines for businesses utilizing cryptocurrencies which stated that "entities that accept virtual currencies such as Bitcoins for their revenue are subject to normal income tax rules". ICOs are also legal in Singapore.

    Singapore means <b>Lion City</b>. You can or not believe whether there have ever been lions leaving on one of <b>63</b> Singapore's islands. You might also argue whether or not there is a true democratic system present in the <i>Republik Singapura</i>. What is not arguable, however, is the fact that Singapore's people have built, literally from scratch, one of the most exciting and successful Country in the World.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Garden City</b>'s modern history is not only exiting but paradoxical as well. Firstly, Singapore obtained its independence (<b>9 August 1965</b>) not as a result of revolutionary war, a military coup or, at best, as a gift from a dissolute foreign power (as it had been the case with all other former colonies elsewhere), but as <b>the punishment</b>. Secondly, Singapore has possessed none <b>mineral resources</b> whatsoever. Thirdly, Singapore didn't have an unifying <b>ideology</b>, religion or a sense of national identity to lay into the foundation of the new society. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, at a time it appeared that the national identity was completely taken away by <b>Malaysian Parliament</b> voting 126-0 to expel Singapore from its realm. The reason for that decision was rising suspicions that <b>People's Action Party</b> (PAP, the major political party of Singapore) has a powerful communist lobby inside it. <b>Lee Kuan Yew</b> (an architect of Singapore's miracle) even stated on the television conference: <i>"For me, it is a moment of anguish."</i>. In only 50 years the <b>Red Dot</b> became one of the wealthiest country on Earth.
    </p>

    <i>Singapore today is a darling of economists and a contentious point in discussions between proponents of classical democratic principles and supporters of "guided democracies".</i>

    Officially the city-state is a parliamentary democracy with the <b>Prime Minister</b> and its Cabinet members appointed by the <b>President</b> which is elected by popular vote. Singapore Parliament has <b>84 members</b> which are also selected on general elections. There is a <b>multi-party system</b> in Singapore with such parties as <b>Parti Pekerja Singapura</b> (Workers' Party, left) or <b>Singapore People's Party</b> (SPP, center) competing on general election with PAP. However, on each elections since <b>1966</b> PAP came as an absolute winner with <b>60</b> or more percents of the votes and 80 or more seats in the Parliament. 
    </p>
    <p>
    International human rights organizations including Amnesty International or Reporters Sans Frontieres often point to an absence of basics freedoms in Singapore including <b>freedom of press</b> or <b>freedom of associations</b>. At the same time, Singapore consistently ranks highest as the <b>least corrupt</b> and the <b>most suitable for business</b> country in the World.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead of pumping oil, gold, diamond or exploiting offshore bankings as do other small but prosperous countries, The Red Dot used its <b>strategic position</b> near Southeast Asian's <b>trade lines</b> to convert itself into giant finance, technology and commodity <b>hub</b>. The rule of law, comprehensive business regulations, political stability and openness to innovations has made the Garden City World's leader by the number of <b>millionaires</b> (every six of Singaporean reported to possess more than $1 million of disposable assets).
    </p>
    <p>
    On the downside, being highly dependent on the state of international <b>trade</b> and <b>finance</b>, Singapore remains sensitive to the World's economic <b>cycles</b>. Reflecting the recent Worldwide economic <b>slowdown</b>, city-state's GDP growth rate has been sliding from almost <b>40%</b> in 2010 to almost <b>0%</b> today. At the same time, low unemployment rate (<b>2%</b>) and rising deflationary pressure (from <b>6%</b> in 2012 to -<b>2%</b> in 2016) suppress investments into Singapore future developments.
    </p>   
    <p>
    <i>The Lion City - the wonder of World's economy in 80s, 90s and 2000s - is today in a growing jeopardy. However, it still presents itself a wonderful illustration of unprecedented social and economic progresses achieved in a life time of one generation.</i>
