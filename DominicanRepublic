<p>
    In February <b>1822</b>, Dominican Republic was annexed by <b>Haiti</b>, just a year after breaking away from Spain. In 1844 Spanish soldiers re-invaded the country but were ousted again in 1865 as a result of the <b>War for Restoration</b>. From <b>1916</b> to <b>1924</b> <i>República Dominicana</i> had been occupied by USA Marines. In 1930 <b>Rafael Trujillo</b> deposed Horacio Lajara and stayed in power until 1960. 5-year civil war was ended in <b>1965</b> by the new USA invasion. In <b>1996</b> a former lawyer - <b>Leonel Antonio Fernandez Reyna</b> - had came to power in the Dominican Republic and stayed there until <b>2012</b> when he was replaced by <b>Danilo Medina Sanchez</b>.

    The lower chamber of Republic's bicameral Parliament - 190-members <b>Cámara de Diputados</b> - is dominated by pro-government, center-right <b>Partido de la Liberación Dominicana</b> (PLD), which holds to 106 seats, it's followed by the left-wing <b>Partido Revolucionario Moderno</b> (PRM) with 42 seats, centrist <b>Partido Reformista Social Cristiano</b> (PRSC) with 18 seats and populist <b>Partido Revolucionario Dominicano</b> (PRD) with 16 seats.

	Dominican republic economy is largely driven by growing tourist sector. Agriculture production had gradually lost its prevalence in country's GDP structure and was replaced by small-scale manufacturing and services. International remittances also play important role in supporting local population's standards of living. This economical structure is not highly beneficiary for high-tech industries growth. On top of that, legal and administrative barriers are still high in Dominican Republic, seed and VC capital are difficult to find and local pool of jobs in high-tech is shallow. At the same time, Dominican startups founders may still find some limited market opportunities in such sectors as FinTech and e-services.

	Dominican Republic Central Bank warned that it does not regulate, nor guarantees digital assets as a means of payment through the country's payment system and that virtual currencies don’t have Central Bank’s support and legal protection. At the same time, trading cryptocurrencies and organizing ICOs are still legal in the Dominican Republic. We may project that they will stay so in the nearest future due to the import orientated economy of the Dominican Republic.
