<p>
    In 1992, when new Paraguayan Constitution was adapted, it introduced the concept of power separation into country's political system and was aimed at strengthening the multi-party democracy. Still, after April 2013 elections, the right-wing "Asociación Nacional Republicana – Partido Colorado" or "Colorado Party" controls the majority (46) seats in the 80-members "Camara de Diputados". The second most represented political force in the Paraguayan lower chamber of Parliament is the centrist "Partido Liberal Radical Autentico" with 28 deputies.

	Paraguayan economy heavily relies on the exploitation of its natural resources and on the agricultural exports. Paraguay is the World's second-largest producer of stevia and tung oil, sixth-largest soybean producer, 8th largest exporter of beef and tenth-largest exporter of wheat. Production of cement, iron ore, and steel takes about 25% of the country's gross domestic product and employs about 31% of the labor force.

	Compare to its big neighbors, Paraguay doesn't have a large population, the developed service economy or international mega-cities, which may boost the development of the local startup ecosystem. Additionally, high administrative and legal barriers as well as deficiencies of the  telecommunication infrastructure further limit the growth perspectives of the Paraguayan technological enterprises. At the same time, the level of competition in the technological sector in Paraguay is relatively modest and costs of running an e-business are still low. That create a number of niche business opportunities for the local startup founders.

<p>
	De facto, selling and buying digital currencies as well as organizing ICOs are legal in Paraguay.The Central Bank of Paraguay, which is the highest monetary authority in the country, or the Banking Superintendent, which regulates banks and finance companies, do not attempt to control or to persecute miners, traders and users of cryptocurrencies. There also are not legal acts which specifically allow to police this sector of economy.
