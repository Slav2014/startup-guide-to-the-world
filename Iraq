<p>
	After April 2014 elections Iraqi Parliament - unicameral, 328-members <b>"Majlis an-Nuwwab al-Iraqiyy"</b> - is dominate by the pro-government "big tent" coalition, which includes 262 deputies and is led by the right-wing nationalist "Itilaf Dawlat al-Qanun" party. The role played by the opposition, represented by the center-right "â€ŽItilaf alarabiya", which holds only to 10 seats in the Majlis, is insignificant. Additionally, the current Iraqi Parliament is informally divided to Sunni and Shiite factions, which reflects the current highly volatile political situation in this country.

	The oil sector traditionally dominates Iraq's economy providing almost 100% of foreign exchange earnings. The high unemployment and low per-capita have came as a result of lack of developments in other industries. Those factors coupled with rising political and social tensions, major telecommunication infrastructure' deficiencies, overbearing bureaucracy and the increasing brain-drain have suppressed the growth of local startups ecosystem.

<p>
	Iraqi financial authorities, including the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), have not yet expressed their official view on cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, as digital money sector stay unregulated, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remain technically legal in Iraq. In the foreseeable future, due to the low Internet penetration rate as well as to general lack of technical capabilities on a governmental level, to regulate this sphere will be both difficult and ineffective there.
