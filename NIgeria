<h2 align = 'center'> Nigeria (Federal Republic of Nigeria) </h2>

<p>
	For almost two decades passed after the end of the civil war in 1999 Nigeria has been ruled by the democratically elected government. Its political system was modeled after that of USA. After the latest elections in April 2015 the lower chamber of Nigerian Parliament - 360-member House of Representatives - is dominated by two political parties: the pro-government, conservative "All Progressives Congress" (APC), which holds to 225 seats, and neo-liberal "People's Democratic Party" (PDP) with 125 deputies.
</p>
<p>
	The important factor, which contributes to current political tensions in Nigeria, is country's economic and cultural division to Christian North and Muslim South. Radical military organizations (most notably "Boko Haram") are still active in northeastern regions of the country and present the direct danger to country's civil order. 
</p>
<p>
	With its almost halve-a-trillion dollars GDP, Nigeria is the African leading economic powerhouse. In 2014, after a decade of record oil prices, Nigeria outperformed its major rival - South Africa. However, despite its heavy reliance on the oil export, Nigerian economy is well diversified into another industries including mining, financial services, manufacturing and information technologies. Another important GDP component is remittances. Almost 18 million Nigerians, which are living in USA and EU, send home more than $20 billion annually.
</p>
<p>
	Nigeria has the largest population in Africa (190 million) - 4x increase since 1970th (50 million). With almost halve of country's population being 14 years old or younger, Nigeria is projected to became one of the major contributors to the overall population growth on the planet in the nearest future. Nigerian major city - Lagos - is the most populated city in Africa (15 million inhabitants).
</p>
<p>
	Nigerian economy is sufficiently large and well diversified to host multiple high-tech startups in wide variety of sectors, including e-commerce, entertainments, social networks, e-marketplaces, e-jobs and FinTech. Lagos is internationally recognized as one of the main African centers of Internet economy. 
</p>
<p>
	Nigerian generation of young and well educated consumers is growing very fast and that creates a stable base for future expansion of local e-businesses. Additionally, Nigeria has maintained long lasting relationships with the Western Wold (almost all of Nigerian oil flows to the North America and Europe). Local expatriates community is very affluent and many promising high-tech companies are launched by Nigerians immigrants.
</p>
<p>
	On the downside, Nigeria is still politically instable, its economy is overdependent on oil export and its bureaucratic system is notoriously slow and inefficient. That creates a challenging market environment, which negatively affects long-term perspectives of the local startup ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
	Nigerian state gate-keepers are not particularly friendly to Bitcoin as well as to other digital currencies. However, they also recognize their technical inability to restrain its usage by the public. Instead, local authorities try to prevent the adaptation of non-centralized electronic money by business and government institutions.
</p>
<p>
	In January 2017, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sent a memorandum to banks and other financial institutions informing them that transactions in virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria, citing money laundering and terrorism financing as reason for this ban. Other financial regulators, such as Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), have also warned public on the danger of digital currencies like Bitcoins, warning that who use digital currencies do so at their own risk.
</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, trading cryptocurrencies as well as organizing ICOs are both technically legal in Nigeria.
