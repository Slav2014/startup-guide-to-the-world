<p>
	South Africa gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1931. In <b>1994</b>, as a result of the first post-apartheid election, political power in the country was seized by the <b>African National Congress</b> (ANC), which, in a period of <b>1948 - 1994</b>, led the resistance to the regime. For the next 20 years ANC had became country's dominant political force. It currently holds on to <b>249 out of 400</b> seats in the <b>National Assembly</b>, and to <b>50 out of 90 seats</b> in the <b>National Council of Provinces</b>. The main opposition - pro-liberal "The Democratic Alliance" (DA) - has, accordingly, 89 and 20 seats.

	South Africa possesses developed finance, telecommunication, transportation, agricultural and manufacturing industries. However, its budget still largely depends on export of mineral resources such as platinum, kyanite, chromium, palladium, gold and diamonds. As a result, prolonged world's commodities prices downfall has sent South African economy into the technical depression.

	The local tech industry has been growing for years with South Africa serving as an entry hub for EU and American VCs to the East African market. However, the prolonged economical crisis, gradually deteriorating investment climate, continuing brain-drain and rising administrative and legal barriers have negatively affected the future development perspectives of the local startup ecosystem.

	Confronted by the macro-economical issues, the Reserve Bank of South Africa (SARB) has been among the slowest of the advanced economies to face the cryptocurrencies legal dilemma. In December 2014 SARB issued a note on digital currencies declaring that virtual currency had "no legal status or regulatory framework". Later, the SARB had announced that it will begin to trial a number of regulations aimed at Internet money. In February 2017, SARB showed its intentions to develop a national virtual currency that would be based on blockchain. Meanwhile, trading Bitcoin and other crypto as well as organizing ICOs stay legal in South Africa.
